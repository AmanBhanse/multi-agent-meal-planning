    "1. MaxMessageTermination (we have used in this exercise): \n",
    "Use to limit the conversation to a limited message. \n",
    "Conversation may not be completed fully before it gets terminated due to low message limit.\n",
    "2. TextMentionTermination:\n",
    "Used to end the conversation with specific keyword.\n",

    "3. TokenUsageTermination:\n",
    "Used to stop the conversation after a certain number of tokens have been used.\n",
    "Agents must report token usage accurately, misreporting can lead to premature or delayed termination.\n",
    "4. TimeoutTermination:\n",
    "Used to end the conversation after a specified duration to ensure timely responses.\n",
    "Conversations might be cut off if the time limit is too short.\n",
    "5. HandoffTermination:\n",
    "Pausing the conversation to allow external input, such as from a user or another system, when an agent requests a handoff.\n",
    "It requires proper handling of handoff messages. If not then conversation may not resume correctly.\n",
    "6. SourceMatchTermination:\n",
    "Ending the conversation after a specific agent responds.\n",
    "Depends on the timely response of the specified agent as delays or absence can affect termination.\n",
    "7. ExternalTermination:\n",
    "Allows external systems or user interfaces to programmatically control the termination, such as a Stop button in chat.\n",
    "It requires reliable external controls.\n",
    "8. StopMessageTermination:\n",
    "Ending the conversation when an agent produces a StopMessage, indicating completion.\n",
    "Agents must be designed to generate StopMessages appropriately if not then it can lead to failure to terminate.\n",

    "Answer: Termination requirements are essential for controlling agent-to-agent communications in order to:\n",
    "Avoid Infinite Loops: Agents may exchange messages forever without termination conditions, which could exhaust available resources.\n",
    "Ensure Efficiency: Conversations can cease when goals are reached by clearly identifying endpoints, which saves computing power.\n",
    "Preserve Control: Termination conditions give programmers the ability to control and anticipate how agent interactions will behave, making sure that they produce the intended results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question: Can the approaches be combined?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Combining termination criteria adds complexity even as it provides flexibility:\n",
    "Added Complexity: Handling several termination conditions might add complexity to the system and make debugging more challenging.\n",
    "Possible Conflicts: Unexpected behavior may result from conflicts between various termination criteria. A TimeoutTermination, for example, may terminate a conversation before a TextMentionTermination condition is satisfied.\n",

    "    - **Agent Setup:** Defining agents with specific roles and integrating tools like the Budget Checker.\n",
    "    - **Coordination Mechanisms:** Using methods like `RoundRobinGroupChat` to manage agent interactions."
